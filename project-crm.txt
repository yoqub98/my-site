SECTION 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW
text
STEK Automotive is a leading provider of vehicle protection solutions, specializing in paint protection films, window tinting, and anti-gravel films. With over 45 years of experience in the protective film market, the company has established itself as an industry innovator, offering cutting-edge products that combine advanced technology with exceptional quality.
The goal was to develop an ERP/CRM platform that unifies business operations between STEK headquarters and their network of distributors and installation studios across 80+ countries. The platform needed to streamline key processes such as warranty registration, claims management, and customer communication — transforming fragmented interactions via phone calls, emails, and messengers into a single centralized digital solution.

SECTION 3: PROBLEM
text
Before the platform existed, STEK's partner network faced significant operational challenges. Distributors and installers were often overloaded with installation work and lacked time for lengthy warranty registration processes. Tracking claim statuses was complicated since the approval workflow involved multiple parties — installers, distributors, and STEK headquarters — with no unified system to monitor progress.
Additionally, the absence of real-time data access made it difficult to make informed decisions about inventory management and sales performance. Communication between stakeholders was scattered across various channels, leading to delays, miscommunication, and inconsistent customer experiences.

SECTION 4: GOALS & SUCCESS METRICS
text
The project aimed to achieve several key objectives: reduce the time required for warranty registration and claims processing by at least 50%, provide real-time visibility into claim statuses for all stakeholders, create an intuitive interface that installers could use efficiently between jobs, and establish a centralized database for warranties, claims, and customer information accessible to authorized users based on their roles.
Success would be measured by user adoption rates among distributors and installers, reduction in average processing time for warranties and claims, decrease in support inquiries related to status tracking, and overall user satisfaction scores from the partner network.

SECTION 5: USER FLOW & INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
text
I developed comprehensive user flows for all key platform processes: warranty registration, claims submission, and communication between clients and distributors. Low-fidelity wireframes were used to quickly visualize and present user scenarios to stakeholders, allowing us to identify pain points and make adjustments before development began.
This approach saved resources and enabled the team to validate ideas early. The information architecture was designed to accommodate multiple user roles — installers, distributors, regional managers, and headquarters staff — each with appropriate access levels and tailored interfaces.

SECTION 6: DESIGN SOLUTIONS
text
The interface was built using a design system based on Tailwind CSS, with base components adapted and extended to meet project-specific requirements. Key design decisions focused on reducing friction and accelerating common tasks across the platform.
For warranty registration, I implemented VIN-based auto-fill functionality that retrieves vehicle data automatically, reducing input time by 40%. Product selection was simplified by replacing manual serial number entry with automatic data retrieval. For claims submission, since most required data already exists in the registered warranty, I designed an auto-population mechanism using the warranty ID — replacing multiple form fields with a single input and reducing claim creation time by 60%.

Row 3 - Text
Claims and warranty data contain extensive information, but users need to see only what's most relevant at a glance. I implemented a card-based interface for displaying claims and warranties, enabling quick visualization of key data while keeping the interface clean and user-friendly. Color-coded status indicators make information instantly scannable, simplifying communication and accelerating decision-making across all user roles.

Row 6 - Text
Warranty records can include multiple products with different specifications, so I designed tabbed navigation within each card to organize information effectively and provide quick access to details for each installed product. Each warranty also contains multiple installation photos taken from various angles — a carousel component allows users to browse all images quickly without opening additional windows.

Row 8 - Text (NEW - add this row to template)
When designing the analytics dashboard, I considered the scale and complexity of STEK's data — the company offers numerous products installed on various vehicles worldwide. I applied key UX principles: information hierarchy to divide data into logical blocks for quick navigation, and intuitive visualization using charts, graphs, and color indicators to simplify comprehension of large data volumes.

For an automotive company, having data structured by vehicle makes and models is essential. Together with the team, we developed a vehicle-centric analytics approach, creating dedicated dashboards for visualizing this data. The interface was designed for maximum clarity, with easy access to sorting and filtering options.

SECTION 9: RESULTS & IMPACT
Outcomes (bullet points)

Accelerated business processes: Automation of warranty registration and claims submission reduced overall task completion time by 60%, with average claim review time decreasing from 10 days to 3 days
