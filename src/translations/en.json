With over 45 years of experience in the protective film market, the company has established itself as an industry innovator, offering cutting-edge products that combine advanced technology with exceptional quality.",
        "The goal was to develop an ERP/CRM platform that unifies business operations between STEK headquarters and their network of distributors and installation studios across 80+ countries. The platform needed to streamline key processes such as warranty registration, claims management, and customer communication — transforming fragmented interactions via phone calls, emails, and messengers into a single centralized digital solution."

I was also responsible for collecting user feedback and implementing design improvements to optimize the product experience.",

      ],
      "problem": [
        "Before the platform existed, STEK's partner network faced significant operational challenges. Distributors and installers were often overloaded with installation work and lacked time for lengthy warranty registration processes. Tracking claim statuses was complicated since the approval workflow involved multiple parties — installers, distributors, and STEK headquarters — with no unified system to monitor progress.",
        "Additionally, the absence of real-time data access made it difficult to make informed decisions about inventory management and sales performance. Communication between stakeholders was scattered across various channels, leading to delays, miscommunication, and inconsistent customer experiences."

          "The project aimed to achieve several key objectives: reduce the time required for warranty registration and claims processing by at least 50%, provide real-time visibility into claim statuses for all stakeholders, create an intuitive interface that installers could use efficiently between jobs, and establish a centralized database for warranties, claims, and customer information accessible to authorized users based on their roles."

          "For warranty registration, I implemented VIN-based auto-fill functionality that retrieves vehicle data automatically, reducing input time by 40%. Product selection was simplified by replacing manual serial number entry with automatic data retrieval. For claims submission, since most required data already exists in the registered warranty, I designed an auto-population mechanism using the warranty ID — replacing multiple form fields with a single input and reducing claim creation time by 60%."
